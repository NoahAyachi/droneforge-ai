Current State:
TenforflowLite working with MobileNetv3_Large Bounding Boxes on Webbrowser (Tensorflow is booboo, and not scalable, so we are replacing with ONNX Runtime Web)

Accomplishment 1:
Run a lightweight feature extraction ONNX model on public/assets/test_image using ONNX runtime web. Print out results of succesful inference on the console log

Accomplishment 2: 
Convert the canva on the top left into frames that can be fed into the ONNX model, ability to overlay bounding box or additional return values on the screen

Accomplishment 3:
Support external camera
